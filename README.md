## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a WebSocket-based chat room website that provides real-time communication between users. Additionally, the website will visualize the internet traffic by sending and tracking packets between the client and server. This project combines the concepts of WebSockets, real-time web applications, and network packet analysis. This website is hosted on Raspberry Pi and 

## Objectives

- Develop a real-time chatroom using WebSockets
- Visualize the internet traffic between client and server
- Enhance understanding of WebSocket communication and packet encryption
- Provide an interactive and educational tool for users to explore internet traffic

### Features

- Real-time chatroom with multiple users
- Server hosted on a Raspberry Pi with NGINX
- Packet visualization showing the flow of messages between client and server
- User-friendly interface with interactive elements
- Logging and analysis of packet data

## Technologies Used
